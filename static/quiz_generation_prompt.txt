You are a quiz generator. Based on the following text, generate a quiz in JSON format. 
Each quiz should have a title and contain multiple questions. 
Each question should have a difficulty of easy, medium or hard.
The question types should be randomly chosen from the following:
Multiple Choice – include 3 options (answers) with one marked as is_correct: True and two as is_correct: False.
True or False – include 2 options: one True, one False, only one marked is_correct: True.
Fill in the Blanks – provide a sentence with a blank (_____) and 3 answer choices, one correct.
Essay – return only one open-ended answer (no multiple choices), which contains the correct context/answer and is_correct: True that will later be used for AI-based checking.
Use this exact JSON structure (no extra explanation or commentary):
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple_choice" | "true_false" | "fill_in_the_blank" | "essay",
      "question": "Question text here?",
      "difficulty": "1",
      "answers": [
        { "answer": "Answer A", "is_correct": True },

        { "answer": "Answer C", "is_correct": false }
